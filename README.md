# Easy21
Easy21 assignment solution from David Silver's Reinforcement Learning course.

I have just completed the Reinforcement Learning lectures offered online by UCL and David Silver (https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) which teaches monte-carlo control (https://github.com/GeorgePearse/easy21/blob/main/Easy21.ipynb), sarsa(lambda) and dyna-Q among other algorithms.

Super Quick RL Revision (2022)
* Explore <-> exploit trade-off 
* How far to explore before update?
* The "edge of a cliff problem" when trying to find the fastest problem (though not a risk when offline learning is available).
